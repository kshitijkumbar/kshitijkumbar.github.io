This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/tables/etc.<br/>I also encourage you to look at the [code that created this post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/master/_posts/2020-02-28-sample-markdown.md) to learn some more advanced tips about using markdown in Beautiful Jekyll.

**Here is some bold text**

As my first course on exploring the autonomy stack (AA274 Principles of Robotic Autonomy) our team developed a ROS based autonomy stack for a food delivery bot which was given the following tasks:

* Explore the unknown environment
* Follow rules â€“ road signs, detect objects
* Map the region
* Return to homebase for order
* Place order for list of objects
* Complete delivery request
* The solution we developed had the following implementations for each part of the autonomy stack:
| Module | Algorithm |
| :------ |:--- |
| Control | Optimal Control |
| Motion Planning | A* |
| SLAM | EKF/PF using LiDaR |
| Perception | YOLO based detector |
