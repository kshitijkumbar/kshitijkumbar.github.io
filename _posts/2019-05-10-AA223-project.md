My previous project on Vehicle Dynamics and control made me aware of the cost of the tracking systems like the dual antenna GPS setup are prohibitive to being integrated into commercial applications. My team mates and I decided to explore cheaper options like using data from the Integrated Measurement Unit to estimate the side slip angle using velocity measurements to deploy non linear filtering methods such as the Extended and Unscented Kalman Filters and non parametric methods such as a specific variant of Particle Filters, namely the Mixture Monte Carlo Localization (MMCL).
