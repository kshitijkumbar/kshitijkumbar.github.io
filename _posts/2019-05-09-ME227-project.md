As a part of my Vehicle Dynamics and Control Project, I developed longitudinal and lateral controllers for a VW Golf GTI to go around a track. I compared two lateral controllers: a look-ahead based controller and a mean-based LQR controller achieving 12 cms of maximum lateral error.

This project was a great learning experience in terms of parameters to consider while going from simulation to deployment. An example of this going wrong can be seen in this video!
